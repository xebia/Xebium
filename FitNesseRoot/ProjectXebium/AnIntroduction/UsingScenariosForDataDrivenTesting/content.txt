!3 Using an existing scenario for data driven testing by providing multiple values
'''Executed steps: '''

1. Open the current page in a browser.

2. Open a menu item from the menu bar (on the left side of the screen) by providing its name replacing the variable ''@menuItem''.

3. Verify the correct page header is shown on top of the opened page by providing it replacing the variable ''@pageTitle''.

!3 1. Create a scenario taking two variables ''responder'' and ''title''
!| scenario | open page | responder | and verify the page header | title |
| start browser | ${BROWSER} | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME}?@responder |
| check | is | verifyTitle | on | @title |
| stop browser |

'''When adding the above scenario to the [[Scenario Library][.ProjectXebium.ScenarioLibrary]] (which is a Fitnesse special page type) it can be called from anywhere in the hierarchy of your Fitnesse project'''

!3 2. A single test using the scenario would look like this:
!| script |
| open page | edit | and verify the page header | Edit: ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |

!3 3. For data driven testing do not use the ''script'' table, just create a table containing the scenario name, with on the second row the variable names, on each following row unique value replacing the variables:
'''All steps of the test will be executed for each provided row with values'''

!| open page and verify the page header |
| responder | title |
| edit | Edit: ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| properties | Properties: ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| whereUsed | Where Used Results |
| refactor | Refactor: ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |

'''After running this test the script that was executed is provided per step behind the executed values'''
