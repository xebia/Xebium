!3 A testscript can be transformed, by renaming it and becomes a reusable scenario
'''Executed steps: '''

1. Open the current page in a browser. 

2. wait for the page title. 

3. Verify the text ''Xebium'' is shown somewhere on the page. 

4. Verify the text ''${PAGE_NAME}'' is shown in the ''h1'' element.

!3 1. Take the ''script'' (as it is used in Example 001) and rename ''script'' into ''scenario'' and provide a logical name to identify your script, in this example we use ''verify page title''
!| scenario | verify page title |
| start browser | ${BROWSER} | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | waitForTitle | on | ${PAGE_PATH}.${PAGE_NAME} |
| ensure | do | verifyTextPresent | on | Xebium |
| ensure | do | verifyText | on | css=h1 | with | ${PAGE_NAME} |
| stop browser |

'''When adding the above scenario to the [[Scenario Library][.ProjectXebium.ScenarioLibrary]] (which is a Fitnesse special page type) it can be called from anywhere in the hierarchy of your Fitnesse project'''

!3 2. Now the ''scenario'' can be executed from the testcase when providing the logical name in script fixture
| script |
| verify page title |

'''After running the test the script that was executed is displayed by expanding the collapsible section'''
