Okay, since you got here, that means you've read the README and performed the steps described. Now it's time to start doing something useful.

!1 Step 1: Install Firefox and Selenium-IDE (SeIDE)

Install firefox by downloading the most recent version from http://mozilla.org/firefox.

Start Firefox and go to http://seleniumhq.org/download/. There click on the download link for SeIDE. Firefox will tell you it prevented the add-on from being downloaded. Click ''Allow''. The plug-in (add-on) will be downloaded and installed. After installation Firefox will request a restart.

The Selenium-IDE tool can be found in the Tools menu. Just launch it!

!1 Step 2: Install the !-FitNesse-! formatter

There are two ways to install the Xebium formatter. The simple way is to go to https://addons.mozilla.org and search for "xebium". The latest version of the Xebium formatter can be installed from there.

If you're working from the source code, the formatter script can be found in main/ide/chrome/content/formats. It needs to be installed in SeIDE in order to output tables understood by !-FitNesse-! (in the ''source'' tab). To install it, open SeIDE and go to ''Options'' -> ''Options...''. Click the ''Formats'' tab and click the ''Add'' button. Provide a descriptive name (e.g. !-FitNesse-! or Xebium) and copy the contents of the formatter script in the text section.

Once that's done, close the options window and select the formatter in the ''Options'' -> ''Format'' menu.

!1 Step 3: Record your test

Make sure the Record button is on and start recording.

!1 Step 4: Define tests in !-FitNesse-!

Copy the contents of the Source tab to your !-FitNesse-! pages. Make sure you've set the Import right:

| Import |
| com.xebia.incubator.xebium |

!1 Step 5: Run your tests from !-FitNesse-!

Run, optimize and test!

Check the ExampleSuite and the other suites for more information on how to write good Xebium tests.
