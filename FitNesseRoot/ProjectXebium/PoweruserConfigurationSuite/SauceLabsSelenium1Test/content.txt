This test mimics the default test script from the [[Sauce Labs][http://saucelabs.com]] website. Check it out!

To run this test, create an account with http://saucelabs.com. Ones logged in, go to "OnDemand", select an OS version and browser and figure out your user name and access key from the code snipped displayed. The username and access-key should be defined in a file saucelabs.properties (there is an example). Restart !-FitNesse-! and run the test.
