Verify that an exception will prevent the rest of the tests on the page from running.

Error pops up here:
!| script | selenium driver fixture | 
| start browser | ${BROWSER} | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| set timeout to | 30000 |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH} |
| reject | do | assertTextPresent | on | Something that's not on the page |
| stop browser |

This one is ignored because of the error in the previous table:
!| script | selenium driver fixture | 
| start browser | ${BROWSER} | on url | http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/ |
| ensure | do | open | on | ${PAGE_PATH} |
| ensure | do | assertTextPresent | on | Xebium |
| stop browser |
